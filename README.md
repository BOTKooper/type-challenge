This repo is collection of my solves for TypeScript [type-challenge](https://github.com/type-challenges/type-challenges)

__Problems marked with "!" in their name are not solved by me yet__

To start all this stuff - just clone repo, all dependencies are here already (why would I bother you installing 1 npm package?).

Notes: 
1. #268 has strange behavior in vscode, but it works well at the [Playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play)
